## Overview

This guide walks you through adding content to your documentation site. Follow these steps to populate each section with your content.

## Quick Start: Adding a New Page

### 1. Create the MDX File

Create a new `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory:

```bash
# Example: Adding a homelab infrastructure page
touch homelab/servers.mdx

# Example: Adding an AIDevOps Vault guide
touch aidevops/vault-setup.mdx

# Example: Adding a blog post
touch blog/2024-11-14-getting-started.mdx
```

### 2. Add Frontmatter

Every MDX file needs frontmatter at the top:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "A brief description of the page"
---

## Your Content Here

Write your content using markdown...
```

### 3. Add to Navigation

Edit `docs.json` and add your page path to the appropriate tab/group:

```json
{
  "group": "Infrastructure",
  "pages": [
    "homelab/servers",        // Add without .mdx extension
    "homelab/networking"
  ]
}
```

## Section-Specific Guides

### Homelab Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Migrate Content from Wiki.js">
    Copy your existing wiki.js pages and convert them to MDX format. Send me the wiki.js content and I can help convert it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Organize by Categories">
    Create subdirectories for different areas:
    - `homelab/infrastructure/` - Servers, hardware
    - `homelab/services/` - Docker, applications
    - `homelab/networking/` - Network config, VLANs
    - `homelab/maintenance/` - Procedures, troubleshooting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Navigation">
    Add pages to the appropriate groups in `docs.json` under the Homelab tab
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example File Structure:**
```
homelab/
├── index.mdx
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── servers.mdx
│   └── hardware.mdx
├── services/
│   ├── docker.mdx
│   └── plex.mdx
└── networking/
    └── vlans.mdx
```

### AIDevOps Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document as You Build">
    Create pages for each component as you work on it with Louis
  </Step>

  <Step title="Vault Documentation">
    Document your Vault journey:
    - `aidevops/vault/deployment.mdx` - How you deployed Vault
    - `aidevops/vault/configuration.mdx` - Initial configuration
    - `aidevops/vault/policies.mdx` - Access policies
    - `aidevops/vault/troubleshooting.mdx` - Issues and solutions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Workflows">
    Document how you and Louis work together asynchronously
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Entry:**
```mdx
---
title: "Deploying HashiCorp Vault"
description: "Step-by-step guide for deploying Vault in our environment"
---

## Deployment Method

We chose to deploy Vault using Docker Compose...

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Network access configured

## Steps

1. Create docker-compose.yml
2. Configure Vault storage backend
3. Initialize Vault
...

## Challenges

We encountered X issue and resolved it by Y...
```

### API Reference Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add New API Pages">
    Create a new MDX file for each API you consume
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Common Operations">
    Include the API calls you actually use with examples
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use OpenAPI (Optional)">
    If the API has an OpenAPI spec, you can auto-generate docs
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Structure:**
```
api-reference/
├── introduction.mdx
├── vault.mdx
├── github-api.mdx
└── openapi/
    └── vault-spec.json
```

### Blog Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name with Dates">
    Use date prefixes for chronological order: `2024-11-14-title.mdx`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Learnings">
    Write about problems solved, new discoveries, or project updates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share with Louis">
    Use blog posts to share progress updates on the AIDevOps project
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Blog Post:**
```mdx
---
title: "Setting Up HashiCorp Vault - Day 1"
description: "Our experience deploying Vault for secrets management"
date: "2024-11-14"
---

## What We Tried

Today we started deploying HashiCorp Vault...

## What Worked

The Docker deployment was straightforward...

## What Didn't Work

We had issues with TLS certificates...

## Next Steps

Tomorrow we'll tackle...

### Research Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Organize by Topic">
    Create subdirectories for different research areas
  </Step>

  <Step title="Aggregate AI Responses">
    Save valuable responses from Claude, ChatGPT, etc. that you want to reference later
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link to Sources">
    Include links to original documentation or research sources
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Structure:**
```
research/
├── index.mdx
├── vault/
│   ├── auth-methods.mdx
│   └── ha-setup.mdx
├── kubernetes/
│   └── networking.mdx
└── devops/
    └── cicd-patterns.mdx
