## Research Collection

This section aggregates valuable research from across various sources - AI conversations, documentation deep dives, technical investigations, and knowledge synthesis.

## Purpose

As you work with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and dig into technologies, you discover valuable insights worth preserving. This is your knowledge repository.
