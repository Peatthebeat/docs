description: 'Documentation for external APIs we consume'

## Overview

This section documents the external APIs we consume in our projects. Rather than documenting APIs we expose, this is a reference for the third-party and internal APIs we integrate with.

## Available API References

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="HashiCorp Vault API" icon="vault" href="/api-reference/vault">
    Secrets management API endpoints and usage examples
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add More APIs" icon="plus" href="/api-reference/introduction">
    Document additional APIs as you integrate them
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Purpose

Use this section to:
- Document API endpoints you frequently call
- Store example requests and responses
- Track authentication methods and credentials management
- Share API integration patterns with your team

## Adding New APIs

You can document APIs using:
1. **OpenAPI/Swagger specs** - Auto-generate from OpenAPI files
2. **Manual MDX pages** - Write custom documentation with examples

Each API should have its own section with clear examples of the calls you make in your projects.
